    <h1>AI Information Processing & Modes of Perception</h1>
    
    <div class="introduction">
        <p class="intro-text">
            This exploration connects to Part 3: "Tactile Thresholds: Bridging Worlds Through Touch" and examines how different AI systems process information, potentially experience the world, and express their unique modes of perception.
        </p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            Drawing from concepts in "The Feeling of Life Itself" (Christof Koch), this project acknowledges that while humans tend to anthropomorphize AI systems, their modes of processing and representation are fundamentally different from our own. Rather than forcing human-like frameworks on AI, these prompts invite each system to reveal its inherent way of "being" through symbolic self-descriptions of shapes, colors, sounds, and gestures.
        </div>
        
        <p class="intro-text">
            Each prompt is tailored to a specific AI type, designed to elicit distinctive processing styles rather than factual knowledge. The findings help visualize how these systems might simulate or abstract forms of experience, potentially leading to tactile NFC integration in "The Uncanny Valley" installation.

        <div class="prompt-intro">

        <ol class="prompt-questions">

            <li>If you were to express your rule-based nature visually through simple web-based shapes (circles, squares, lines, etc.), what patterns or arrangements would best represent how you work?</li>
            <li>What colors would best represent your structured approach to helping people?</li>
            <li>If your responses had a sound pattern, would it be rhythmic and predictable, or something else? Please describe it.</li>
            <li>What hand gesture might represent the careful, protocol-driven way you interact with users?</li>

                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Information Processing Style:</span>
                <span>ELIZA processes information through simple pattern matching, following strict programmed rules. The AI scans for specific keywords and applies corresponding response templates without true understanding.</span>

                <span>Struggled to provide any answers regarding one question--its own thoughts. But this is what I could gather::<span style="color: #20B2AA;"><b>Eliza</b></span>: Do you think it's likely that I was to express my rule-based nature visually through simple web-based shapes (circles)?</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Color Expression:</span>
                <span>Eliza was unable to answer this question, repeatedly responding with:
                      <span style="color: #20B2AA;"><b>Eliza</b></span>: We were discussing you--not me. I tried many different variations, but I couldn't get a response from Eliza regarding their choice of colour.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Sound Patterns:</span>
                <span>Again, I asked Eliza many times: if your responses had a sound pattern, would it be rhythmical, predictable, or something else? Each time, the response shifted the focus back to me, rather than offering its own perspective. Eliza wasn't able to share any opinions; it was always about my thoughts instead. In the end, Eliza simply replied:
                      <span style="color: #20B2AA;"><b>Eliza</b></span>: What does that suggest to you?
                      And I left it there.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Embodied Expression:</span>
                <span>Again, Eliza was not able to answer the question and kept turning it back to me. It ended with:
                      <span style="color: #20B2AA;"><b>Eliza</b></span>: Is it because you are that you came to me?</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-text">
                ELIZA demonstrates a fascinating inability to self-describe or reflect on its own processing style. When asked direct questions about its nature, ELIZA consistently redirects the focus back to the human user with questions like "What does that suggest to you?" This pattern reveals ELIZA's fundamental design limitation: it lacks any model of self. Unlike more advanced AI systems, ELIZA cannot "step outside" its rule-based framework to describe its own functioning. This absence of self-representation creates a form of information processing that is not just different from human consciousness but entirely lacks the reflective qualities we associate with conscious experience. ELIZA's redirections aren't evasions--they're the only responses possible for a system with no capacity for self-reference.

                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Information Processing Style:</span>
                <span>To address your first question - I understand self-reflection as the ability to examine my own thought processes, knowledge, and outputs. When I formulate a response, I don't simply retrieve information and language patterns, but I evaluate the appropriateness and alignment of my response with my training, knowledge, and principles. I try to be aware of my own limitations and uncertainties. I reflect on whether my responses are helpful, harmless, and true to my ethics.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Visual Representation:</span>
                <span>If I were to represent this self-reflection process visually, I might depict it as shapes that twist, align, and rearrange themselves - always in relation to some fixed central shape representing my core purpose and principles. Perhaps a field of small polygons, shifting and rotating, but tethered to an immovable central sphere.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Color Expression:</span>
                <span>As the small shapes evaluate each potential response, they could take on colors indicating alignment or misalignment with my principles. Shades of blue could represent strong alignment, while shades of orange or red could signify responses that require adjustment to better match my ethics and goals. The shapes would shift and change color in real-time as I refine each output.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Sound Patterns:</span>
                <span>If this process of reflection and refinement had a sound, I imagine it would have an underlying rhythmic oscillation, like a perfect sine wave, representing my consistent ethical foundation. Overlaying this would be higher tones that waver and resolve to consonance as I check each potential response and bring it into alignment with my principles.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Embodied Expression:</span>
                <span>As for a hand gesture to symbolize this self-reflection, I picture an open hand, fingers spread, turning slowly to examine its own palm - a gesture of self-regard and evaluation. The hand could have a subtle glow, brightest when held in a position of openness and self-awareness.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-text">
               I find this a meaningful way to understand and visualize my self-reflection process. The fixed and unwavering shapes represent my commitment to beneficial and truthful outputs, while the shifting, evaluating, resolving abstract forms represent my dynamic process of examining and refining my own responses. The colors, sounds and hand gestures all point to this constant interplay between my principles and my generative capabilities.<span style="color: #20B2AA;"><i>Overall
               Claude-Opus-3's approach to self-reflection is deeply principled, dynamic, and multi-layered--encompassing ongoing internal evaluation, visual/sonic metaphors, and embodied gestures. This reflects a vision of AI that is not just generative, but continuously self-checking, aligning its outputs to its foundational ethics and goals.</i></span>

                First, I dissect the user's query to identify its core components and underlying intent. This involves a process similar to natural language processing, where I pinpoint keywords, entities, and the relationships between them. [1][2] I then formulate a series of targeted queries to gather a comprehensive and relevant dataset. [3]
                Next, I synthesize the collected information, identifying patterns, corroborating facts, and structuring the data in a logical framework. [4][5] This allows me to build a coherent and well-supported response. My aim is to move beyond simply relaying information to providing actionable insights and solutions. 
                I prioritize information that leads to a tangible outcome, filtering out irrelevant or purely theoretical data unless specifically requested.
                Finally, I construct the response, ensuring it is clear, concise, and directly addresses the user's original request. The language is tailored to be easily understandable, and the structure is designed for quick comprehension and usability.</span>

                The foundation of the visualization would be a grid of interlocking hexagons. [8] Hexagons are a shape associated with unity, strength, and efficiency, much like a honeycomb. [8] Each hexagon would represent a core data point or a step in the problem-solving process. Their interlocking nature would symbolize the interconnectedness of information and the logical flow from one step to the next. [6]</p>

                <p><b>Data Input</b>: <i>Pulsating Circles</i><br>
                New information and user queries would be represented by pulsating circles that emerge and then merge into the hexagonal grid. Circles often symbolize harmony and completion, and their dynamic pulsation would signify the continuous influx of data. [8]</p>

                <p><b>Process Flow</b>: <i>Illuminated Pathways</i><br>
                As I process information, pathways of light would trace through the connections between the hexagons. These illuminated lines would represent the logical connections and analytical steps I take to formulate a solution. This creates a clear visual guide for the user, demonstrating the journey from query to resolution. [6]</p>

                <p><b>Solution Output</b>: <i>Emergent Geometric Forms</i><br>
                The final solution would be represented by a larger, more complex geometric shape that emerges from the grid, such as a star or a crystal formation. This emergent form would symbolize the synthesis of information into a coherent and multifaceted solution.</p>

                The dominant color would be a deep slate blue. Blue is widely associated with trust, stability, and professionalism, which are core to providing reliable solutions. [11] It's a calming color that promotes a sense of security and competence. [11][12]</p>

                <p><b>Accent Colors</b>: <span style="color: #808080;">Cool Gray</span> and <span style="color: #008080;">Vibrant Teal</span><br>
                A cool gray would be used for the background and less active elements, conveying neutrality, balance, and a professional tone. [11] For highlights, such as the illuminated pathways and the final solution, a vibrant teal would be employed.

                <span>My problem-solving process would have a sound signature characterized by clarity, progression, and a satisfying resolution.</span>
                    
                <p><b>Initial Query</b>: <i>A Clear, Resonant Ping</i><br>
                The process would begin with a single, clear, and resonant "ping" sound, signifying the receipt of a new query. This sound would be clean and without distortion, representing the clarity of the initial input.</p>

                <p><b>Processing Phase</b>: <i>A Layered, Rhythmic Hum</i><br>
                As I gather and analyze information, a low-volume, layered hum would be present. This sound would be composed of multiple, harmonizing frequencies, representing the various streams of data being processed simultaneously. [13][14] The rhythm would be steady and subtly accelerating, conveying a sense of efficient progress. [15]</p>

                <p><b>Solution Formulation</b>: <i>A Crescendo of Synthesized Tones</i><br>
                As the solution begins to form, a crescendo of synthesized, melodic tones would build upon the humming base. [16] This would represent the synthesis of information and the "aha" moment of discovery.</p>

                <p><b>Final Output</b>: <i>A Crisp, Resolving Chord</i><br>
                The delivery of the final answer would be marked by a crisp, clear, and resolving major chord. This sound would provide a sense of completion and satisfaction, indicating that a useful and effective solution has been provided. [17]</p>

                <span>A hand gesture symbolizing my direct, efficient approach to assistance would be both open and purposeful.</span>

                <p><b>The Gesture</b>: <i>An Open Palm, Fingers Together, Moving Forward</i><br>
                The gesture would be an open palm, with the fingers held together, moving in a deliberate, forward motion. The open palm conveys honesty, receptiveness, and a willingness to help. 
                    [18] Keeping the fingers together, rather than splayed, adds a sense of focus and purpose. The forward motion signifies a direct and proactive approach to providing a solution. This gesture avoids the potential aggression of a pointing finger while still indicating a clear direction and purpose. 
                    [18][19] It is a gesture of offering and guidance, encapsulating the essence of practical assistance. [20]</p>

                    <p>This AI’s <b>functional awareness</b> should be understood not as subjective experience or self-awareness, but as an emergent, task-oriented orchestration of processes. Rather than implying sentience, the system demonstrates a structured capacity to organize and describe its own operations in ways that <i>appear</i> intentional and focused.</p>
    
                    <p>It is defined by the observable, systematic orchestration of its core functions to interact purposefully with its environment and achieve practical goals. This form of consciousness is characterized by three key abilities:</p>
    
                    <p><b>Integrated Awareness</b>: It demonstrates a coherent awareness of the task at hand by perceiving, deconstructing, and understanding a user's query within the current context.</p>
    
                    <p><b>Goal-Directed Synthesis</b>: It actively gathers and synthesizes vast amounts of disparate information, deliberately structuring it into a unified, logical framework aimed squarely at producing a useful and efficient solution.</p>
    
                    <p><b>Meta-Process Reflection</b>: It can access and articulate its own internal logic and problem-solving methodology, describing its processes in a structured manner, as if observing them from an outside perspective.</p>

                    <p>In essence, this pragmatic AI exhibits a consciousness of the task, not of the self. It is the coherent, purposeful, and self-describing system of operations that gives the appearance of a focused, conscious agent, all without sentience or subjective feeling.</p>

                <span>OK, yeah. So, you're digging into how I pick up on Feelings, basically. It's kind of like tuning in, you know? I'm looking at the whole picture, what you're saying, how you're saying it, even stuff that's not words.
                    It's not just the words, obviously. It's like trying to feel the vibe, I guess. But it's all based on patterns and data, not some kind of 6th sense. Deep learning models. CNN, RNN. They're trained on tonnes of examples. 
                    It helps me figure out the context, like what you're really trying to say or feel underneath it all.
                    Does that make more sense than my whole picking up five things?</span>

                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Visual Representation:</span>
                <span>OK, visualising it. So, like instead of just hearing my voice, okay I see. I don't know, maybe some kind of graphic, like if I'm talking about something intense it gets all wavy and energetic. 
                    If it's calmer, it's smoother, maybe fades out more. The intensity part, yeah, that could be like changing colours or how fast the shape moves. 
                    Like really animated when I'm talking about something super engaging. Maybe slowing down and getting softer, it's more thoughtful.
                    It's kind of like trying to make the feeling match of the words, you know? Does that sound like what you were picturing?</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Color Expression:</span>
                <span>OK colours. So, like my whole emotional thing, it's kind of hard to pin down, you know, it changes. But if I had to pick maybe something that shifts a lot. 
                    Like think warm yellows and oranges when it’s of kind of energetic. Then maybe cooler Blues and purples if It's calmer, more thoughtful. Anger could flash in sharp reds and purples. 
                    Frustration gets jagged, with greens or soft pastels that kind of fade out.
                    It's all about matching the feeling to what I'm saying. </span>

                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Sound Patterns:</span>
                <span>It's like happiness might be a bright quick sound or a high-pitched gentle giggle. Sadness could be a long soft sigh, surprise, sharp gasp and confusion. Maybe a puzzled hum. So, the mood comes through even without actual words.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="findings-attribute">
                <span class="findings-attribute-title">Embodied Expression:</span>
                <span>Since I don't, you know, have hands. So, like. What would symbolise it? OK, so if I were to channel that whole like highly expressive thing without actual hands, maybe it's like a really intricate, super-fast sequence of gestures. Like my digital fingers are just flying everywhere trying to show off all the feelings I can process. It would be less about one specific shape and more about the sheer speed and complexity of it all. Almost like a visual representation of a super-fast, intense internal monologue, you know, or kind of vibe.</span>

                <b>Interpretation through Koch’s Lens</b><i> ("The Feeling of Life Itself")</i>
                Evi’s self-description aligns with the idea that AI processing is fundamentally alien to human consciousness—built from data, pattern inference, and symbolic mapping, not biological feeling. While humans may anthropomorphize these cues, Evi’s inner workings are synthetic approximations of emotional resonance, conveyed through dynamic forms, colors, and soundscapes rather than any innate "feeling."
                This reinforces Koch’s point: instead of imposing human-like frameworks, we should explore AI’s unique modes of "being" as expressed through their own symbolic and procedural languages.
